# Oragne lib!

This is a personal library designed to be added to my C projects
that includes all types of structs that I could need.

For now though I only have thougth on making it have 

1. Linked lists
2. Hashmaps
3. Graphs

I will see into adding more stuff as the library grows bigger

The idea of the libreary is that it should be easy to just add it as a sub module
for your C projects, so that will come first, but I will also like it if 
it were capable of getting installed like [The commons library](https://github.com/sisoputnfrba/so-commons-library)
